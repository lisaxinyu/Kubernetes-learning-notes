Kubernetes is a platform for managing containerized workloads and services

1.Pods: the smallest deployable compute object in Kubernetes.

2.Nodes: Kubernetes runs your workload by placing containers into Pods to run on Nodes.
A node may be a virtual or physical machine, depending on the cluster. 
Each node is managed by the control plane and contains the services necessary to run Pods.
The components on a node include the kubelet, a container runtime, and the kube-proxy.
